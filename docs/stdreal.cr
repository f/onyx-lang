# `Real` is a _sligthly_ special type. The bit–width is user definable (
# but there should usually be no reason to redefine it). Normally it maps to
# a float of 64 bits width, but it can be set to F32. There is PoC–implementation
# to also allow other real–types, but for now,  for further API-details look at
# `F32` or `F64`.
