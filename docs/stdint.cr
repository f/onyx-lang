# `Int` is a _sligthly_ special type. The bitâ€“width is user definable (
# but there should usually be no reason to redefine it). Normally it maps to
# an int of the same width as the pointer width of the architecture, so 64 bit int
# for 64 bit arch. So for further API-details look at `I32` or `I64`.

# struct StdInt
